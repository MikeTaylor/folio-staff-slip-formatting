Thomas Trutt (Cornell) told Charlotte:

> From my initial searching it looks like CKEditor would meet all the requirements: https://ckeditor.com/
>
> Their Accessibility Conformance Report: https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/accessibility.html#accessibility-conformance-report-vpat
>
> It looks like by default is uses HTML.
>
> They have a interface builder you can use -- toolbars are customizable: https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/builder/?redirect=docs
>
> Try this one: https://github.com/folio-org/stripes-template-editor/blob/54b044a39a323b72b1b84e82b5a67655502d14e4/src/sanitizer.js

But this is non-open source, so a complete non-starter for FOLIO.
