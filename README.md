# folio-staff-slip-formatting

My private notes on the extensions to FOLIO staff-slip formatting
capabilities required by the National Library of Sweden.

Two relevant high-level issues in Jira:
* [UXPROD-5031 -- Expand the Staff slip editor to allow for more complex layouts](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/browse/UXPROD-5031)
* [UXPROD-5158 -- Requirements for WYSIWYG Template editing solution](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/browse/UXPROD-5158)
