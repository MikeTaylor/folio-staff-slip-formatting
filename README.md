# folio-staff-slip-formatting

My private notes on the extensions to FOLIO staff-slip formatting
capabilities required by the National Library of Sweden.

There are two relevant high-level issues in Jira:
* [UXPROD-5031 -- Expand the Staff slip editor to allow for more complex layouts](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/browse/UXPROD-5031)
* [UXPROD-5158 -- Requirements for WYSIWYG Template editing solution](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/browse/UXPROD-5158)

Thomas Trutt (Cornell) tells Charlotte that "they already completed the spike UXPROD-5158" (although it's not clear who _they_ are; the issue is still shown as OPEN).

Mockups of how NLS would like slips to look can be found in [`examples`](examples).

Candidate solutions are discussed in [`solutions`](solutions).
